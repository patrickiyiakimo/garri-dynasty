      <p>The hunger destroyer</p>
      <p>
        For over a century, Garri has been more than just a staple<br/> food in
        Nigeria â€“ it has been a lifeline, nourishing generations and sustaining<br/>
        communities <br/>through times of plenty and scarcity alike. Since its
        introduction in 1900, <br/>Garri has played a pivotal role in the Nigerian
        diet, <br/>offering a reliable source of energy and nutrition to millions.
